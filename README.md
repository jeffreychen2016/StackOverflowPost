# StackOverflowPost

## Description

This is an exercise question from an online tutotrial:

Design a class called Post. This class models a StackOverflow post. It should have properties
for title, description and the date/time it was created. We should be able to up-vote or down-vote
a post. We should also be able to see the current vote value. In the main method, create a post,
up-vote and down-vote it a few times and then display the the current vote value. 

## How To Use

1. Hit Ctrl + F5 to start the console app.
2. Once the app is started, you will see the list of options. You can up-vote, donwn-vote, and view the post detail.
